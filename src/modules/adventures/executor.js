/*
 * Wave executor of an adventure run.
 *
 * Takes the waves of a started run one after the other through
 * Gate -> Position -> Supply (-> Unload -> Supply) -> Load -> Verify ->
 * Reach (-> Settle -> Reach) -> Attack -> Confirm. plan() does one step per
 * call. The scheduler only calls it while no adventures queue entry is
 * pending, so every attempt a step started has finished (or was dropped by a
 * queue reset) when the next step runs. Each step therefore observes the game
 * first and never relies on a callback having fired.
 *
 * A general at the star can only be placed on a free landing field, so
 * Position reaches a line grid off the landing fields in two steps, through
 * a landing field.
 *
 * Lines that can act go first. A line whose grid is held by a field general
 * who is leaving it himself waits for him, and a swap or a ring of such waits
 * sends one member to the star, from where he hops back like any star
 * general. Each Position round that shows re-enters Position, so a chain of
 * waits costs no round count; only a grid held by something that does not
 * leave goes to Settle.
 *
 * Every order runs through S.core.actions.attempt with the existing core
 * defs. The round handling (results kept in memory on runState.round, late
 * callbacks dropped) and the Supply -> Unload -> Load -> Verify flow are
 * shared with the load at home and live in the loader; this file passes
 * the wave steps to them.
 *
 * Attacks and camp buffs are paced by the 'adventures.attack' queue action.
 * The battle window sends the first line at once and each later line its own
 * time after the previous send. The kernel delay is a gap after an entry, so
 * the pacer re-enqueues itself and compares wall time instead. The sent
 * marker of a line is persisted before its packet goes out, so a gap is
 * always measured from a real send and a reload never sends a line twice: a
 * line sent but not seen pauses the run until the user has looked.
 *
 * A wave is never skipped. Every failed check or timeout pauses with the
 * wave, general, target and reason; Resume re-enters Gate of the same wave.
 * A line whose camp was beaten earlier in the run is dropped, which is no
 * skipped wave: its fight is over, and the rest of the wave still runs.
 * After the last wave is confirmed the run hands over to the end of the
 * map (RunStep.PackStar); the series steps run elsewhere.
 *
 * Template steps (Unload, Send home, Pause, Pause x min) are entries of the
 * run's wave list between the battle files. They are no waves: plan() hands
 * such an entry to the shared step driver (loader.runStep) with the contract
 * of its kind from the steps registry, and the kind's next hook moves on
 * through advance(), the same tail a confirmed wave takes. The start check
 * counts only the battle files as waves and has the registry check the step
 * rows in their place in the list.
 *
 * Bundle slot: module file; top level assigns S.modules.adventures.executor
 * and registers the pacer queue action; state, loader, steps, templates,
 * watcher and every core are read at call time.
