/*
 * Send guard: a send to an idle explorer or geologist only counts once the
 * specialist is seen to leave Idle.
 *
 * When the client stops applying search tasks, every send still reports
 * success, the specialist stays Idle and the next plan sends it again, without
 * limit. The guard keeps a pending entry per sent uid. The module's next plan
 * passes its own specialist read to settle(), which judges what it can see: a
 * pending specialist that is no longer Idle is verified, one that is still
 * Idle after VERIFY_MS on a complete read missed. A miss holds that uid with a
 * delay that doubles per miss up to HOLD_MAX_MS; only a verify clears the
 * count. BREAKER_MISSES misses in a row, counted in send order across every
 * owner, open the breaker that pauses dispatch, warns once and lets one probe
 * through every PROBE_COOLDOWN_MS. The first verified send closes it. The
 * breaker is one S.core.breaker instance, shared by every specialist module;
 * this file keeps the pending entries, holds and the settle judgement.
 *
 * Verification is deferred to the module's plan instead of running through
 * S.core.actions.attempt: a batch of sends would each hold the shared queue
 * while polling, and the plan already reads its specialists once anyway.
 *
 * One guard is shared by every specialist module, because a client that stops
 * applying tasks hits them all at once and a per-module guard could not see
 * the other's misses. What to send and when stays in the modules.
 *
 * Unknown is never evidence. Only a send that really left is noted. A read
 * that dropped entries never produces a miss, since a half-read entry reads
 * Idle, but a busy reading from it is still a verify. An entry that could not
 * be judged before STALE_MS is dropped without counting or holding.
 *
 * State is memory only and built fresh each time this file runs, so a script
 * reload resets every pending entry, hold and the breaker.
 *
 * Bundle slot: core, under core/specialists/ after orders.js and, like every
 * file there, before specialists.js; core/breaker.js loads earlier, so the
 * breaker instance is created at load time. Every reference to
 * S.core.specialists.uniqueIdKey/status happens at call time.
