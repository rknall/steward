# Using the Core Library

`Steward.core.*` is the general TSO library. Every module uses it; nothing else should. This document is the rulebook for module authors.

## What core gives you

| Namespace            | Purpose                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Steward.core.zone`        | Current zone identity, navigation, predicates.         |
| `Steward.core.buildings`   | Find, list, classify buildings.                        |
| `Steward.core.specialists` | Find, list, classify, dispatch specialists.            |
| `Steward.core.deposits`    | Find, list deposits.                                  |
| `Steward.core.packets`     | `SendServerAction` and `SendMessagetoServer` wrappers. |
| `Steward.core.locale`      | `loca.GetText` shorthand + safe formatter.            |
| `Steward.core.events`      | Active events and their per-task modifiers.           |

Detailed API per file lives in `docs/analysis/PLAN.md` (P2 file scopes). Once P2 lands, each `core/*.js` source file's IIFE will be the canonical reference.

## Rule 1: don't reach past the helpers

Core returns **raw game objects**. That is intentional — it keeps the layer cheap. But it means it's tempting to chain into game internals from your module:

```js
// BAD — module reaches into the game API directly
if (b.GetGOContainer().mIsAttackable && !b.GetGOContainer().mIsLeaderCamp && b.GetGOContainer().ui !== 'enemy') {
    // ...
}

// GOOD — module asks core
if (Steward.core.buildings.isAttackable(b) && !Steward.core.buildings.isEnemy(b)) {
    // ...
}
```

If a helper you need doesn't exist yet, **add it to core**. Three signs you should:

1. You're about to write the same multi-step expression a second time.
2. The expression depends on game-internal field names (anything starting with `m`, `Get*`, `_`).
3. The expression encodes a meaningful concept (`isCollectible`, `isHome`, `hasArmy`).

Helpers are cheap to add. The cost of *not* adding them — duplicated logic, decay when the game API changes — is high.

## Rule 2: never compare against bare strings

Steward exposes shared enums for everything that has a fixed set of values:

```js
Steward.Building              // BuildingButchers, BuildingBakery, …
Steward.SpecialistType        // SpecialistGeneral, SpecialistCarrier, SpecialistExplorer, SpecialistGeologist
Steward.SpecialistStatus      // StatusIdle, StatusWorking, StatusTraveling, StatusReturning, StatusUnavailable
Steward.SkillModifier         // ModifierSearchTime, ModifierLootRolls, …
Steward.ExplorerTask          // TaskExplorerShort, …
Steward.GeologistTask         // TaskGeologistSearch, …
Steward.Priority              // PriorityCritical, PriorityNormal, PriorityIdle
```

Always use the enum reference at the call site:

```js
// BAD
if (Steward.core.specialists.classify(s) === 'SpecialistCarrier') { /* ... */ }
if (skill.modifier === 'searchtime') { /* ... */ }

// GOOD
if (Steward.core.specialists.classify(s) === Steward.SpecialistType.Carrier) { /* ... */ }
if (skill.modifier === Steward.SkillModifier.SearchTime) { /* ... */ }
```

The values are prefixed strings (`'SpecialistCarrier'`, not `'CARRIER'`) precisely so they're self-explanatory if they ever leak into a log or settings file. Don't undo that by hard-coding them.

## Rule 3: respect the cache contract

`Steward.core.buildings.list()` is cached per scheduler tick. The cache is cleared at the start of every tick — within a single tick, repeated calls are cheap and consistent.

If your module **mutates the building set** (places a mine, destroys a depleted deposit, upgrades a building), call:

```js
Steward.core.buildings.invalidate();
```

Otherwise subsequent reads in the same tick will return the stale snapshot.

You don't need to invalidate after server packets that *trigger* an asynchronous mutation — invalidation is for when you've taken an action whose effect you need to see immediately. Most modules never need this.

## Rule 4: use the locale wrapper

```js
// BAD
loca.GetText('BUI', 'FlyingHouse');
loca.GetText('RES', 'Coin');

// GOOD
Steward.core.locale.bui('FlyingHouse');
Steward.core.locale.res('Coin');
```

The wrapper handles missing-key fallback uniformly, and centralises the categorical strings (`'BUI'`, `'RES'`) so a typo doesn't ship.

## Rule 5: `pickTask` and `pickDeposits` are the source of truth

When choosing what an explorer or geologist should do next, ask core:

```js
var task     = Steward.core.specialists.pickTask(explorer);
var deposits = Steward.core.specialists.pickDeposits(geologist);
```

These methods are event-aware. They consult `Steward.core.events.*` internally so your module doesn't need to. When a new event ships, the recommendation logic updates in one place.

If you're tempted to compute your own preferred task or deposit, check whether the desired behaviour is "the canonical answer plus a constraint" — if so, filter the result of `pickTask` rather than recomputing it.

## Rule 6: dispatch composition is module concern

Core stays thin. The low-level send is in core:

```js
Steward.core.specialists.send(spec, taskType, params, responder);
```

The composed operation — "send geologists to find iron until we have 3 deposits queued" — is **module concern**. Each module composes its own dispatch logic over `available` + `pickX` + `send`. We don't centralize these compositions because different modules want different policies.

## Rule 7: wrap risky calls

Every game-API call can throw — the API surface is large and not all of it is documented. Wrap calls in try/catch and log the failure:

```js
function name(b) {
    try {
        return b.GetBuildingName_string();
    } catch (e) {
        Steward.kernel.warn('buildings', 'name failed:', e);
        return null;
    }
}
```

Core helpers do this internally so module code doesn't have to. When you're forced to reach past a helper (rare), do it yourself.

Don't wrap calls just to swallow them — autoTSO had 237 silent try/catch blocks and the cost of that decision is exactly why Steward exists. Always log the error with category context.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern                                   | Use instead                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `building.GetGOContainer().mIsAttackable`     | `Steward.core.buildings.isAttackable(building)`          |
| `loca.GetText('BUI', name)`                   | `Steward.core.locale.bui(name)`                          |
| `if (status === 'IDLE')`                      | `if (status === Steward.SpecialistStatus.Idle)`          |
| Reaching into another module's settings       | Don't. Cross-module communication is via the kernel.     |
| Holding onto a `list()` result across ticks   | The cache is per-tick. Re-fetch every tick.              |
| Hard-coding deposit type names                | Add an entry to `Steward.Building` and use the enum.     |
| Using `console.log`                           | Use `Steward.kernel.log('module-id', …)`.                |

## When to extend core

Core grows as patterns become apparent. The flow:

1. You write a module and find yourself doing the same multi-step game-API expression more than once.
2. Add a helper to the relevant `core/*.js` file.
3. Update this document if the helper deserves explicit mention.

Core changes ship with their consumers. We don't pre-emptively design helpers for hypothetical modules.
