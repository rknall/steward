# Scheduler

The scheduler decides which module runs when. It uses three priority tiers and round-robins within each tier so no module can starve another.

> **Status:** This document specifies the scheduler contract. Implementation lands in P1 (`src/kernel/50_scheduler.js`). Module authors should code against this surface from day one.

## Priority tiers

```js
Steward.Priority.Critical    // === 'PriorityCritical'
Steward.Priority.Normal      // === 'PriorityNormal'
Steward.Priority.Idle        // === 'PriorityIdle'
```

| Tier       | Use for                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Critical` | Time-sensitive responses — accepting a mid-flight trade, mail-driven actions. |
| `Normal`   | Standard automation — production, collection, dispatch.                      |
| `Idle`     | Cleanup, observability, drift correction.                                   |

A higher tier always runs before a lower one in a given tick. Within a tier, modules round-robin so they get fair access.

## Tick model

```
tick(now):
    try:
        ctx = buildContext()                    # zone, now, session flags
        for tier in [Critical, Normal, Idle]:
            try:
                modules = registry.byTier(tier)     # array of module specs
                cursor  = scheduler.cursors[tier]   # 0..modules.length-1
                for offset in 0..modules.length:
                    m = modules[(cursor + offset) % modules.length]
                    if not safeIsReady(m, ctx): continue
                    safePlan(m, ctx)                # may enqueue tasks
                scheduler.cursors[tier] = (cursor + 1) % modules.length
            catch: log (rate-limited)               # later tiers still run
        queue.drain()
    finally:
        schedule(tick, tickInterval)
```

The tick always reschedules. A throwing tier is logged (rate-limited) and the later tiers and the drain still run. The scheduler writes a heartbeat line from the tick itself every `HEARTBEAT_MS`, so a missing heartbeat means the timer or AIR stopped, for example while paused: a pause stops the tick and its heartbeat. A tick later than `TICK_GAP_FACTOR` intervals logs one gap WARN.

The cursor advance happens **once per tier per tick**, regardless of how many modules in that tier had work. That's the round-robin guarantee: if module A and module B are both `Normal`, they alternate first-look across ticks.

## Module registration

```js
Steward.kernel.register({
    id:       'collect',
    priority: Steward.Priority.Normal,
    isReady:  function (ctx) {
        return ctx.zone.isHome && ctx.now > state.cooldownUntil;
    },
    plan:     function (ctx) {
        // Inspect game state via Steward.core.*
        // Enqueue work via Steward.kernel.queue.add(name, params, delay)
    }
});
```

### `isReady(ctx)` contract

- **Cheap.** Called every tick for every module. If your readiness check needs an expensive game query, cache the result.
- **Pure boolean return.** Returning `null`/`undefined` is treated as `false`.
- **Throws are swallowed.** A throw is treated as `false` and logged at WARN.
- Receives `ctx`:
  - `ctx.now` — `Date.now()` at tick start.
  - `ctx.tick` — monotonically incrementing integer.
  - `ctx.zone` — `{ id, isHome, isAdventure, isFriend }` snapshot.
  - `ctx.session` — module-shared session flags (read-only).

### `plan(ctx)` contract

- **Side-effects allowed.** Called only when `isReady` returned true.
- **No return value expected.** Modules enqueue work via `Steward.kernel.queue.add(...)`; the kernel doesn't read what `plan` returns.
- **Throws are swallowed.** Logged at ERROR. The module's next tick is unaffected.
- **Don't block.** `plan` should return quickly; the queue handles paced execution.

## Action queue

Modules enqueue actions:

```js
Steward.kernel.queue.add(name, params, delay);
```

| Argument | Type     | Meaning                                                           |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`   | string   | A registered action (e.g. `'collect'`, `'sendSpecialist'`).      |
| `params` | array    | Positional arguments passed to the action handler.               |
| `delay`  | number   | Optional. Milliseconds to wait before running this action.        |

Actions are registered once at boot:

```js
Steward.kernel.queue.action('collect', function (params) {
    var grid = params[0];
    Steward.core.packets.sendAction(/* ... */);
});
```

The queue drains FIFO with a default 1500 ms inter-action gap (overridable per action via `delay`). The gap runs from the previous action, so an entry runs as soon as its delay has passed. The queue is drained at the end of each tick and of each module wake (see Module wake), not only on the tick.

### Module tagging and cancellation

Every action enqueued from inside a module's `plan()` or `boot()` is automatically tagged with that module's `id` (the kernel sets a "current module" pointer around the call so `queue.add` can read it).

This makes per-module cancellation safe and cheap:

```js
Steward.kernel.queue.cancelByModule('collect');   // drops every pending entry tagged 'collect'
Steward.kernel.queue.depthByModule('collect');    // diagnostic
```

The `collect` module uses this when the user toggles its master switch off — pending actions disappear in milliseconds instead of draining for ~45 s. Modules should mirror the pattern when they have an "off" switch with pending side effects.

An entry added while a tagged action is running inherits that action's module tag. A self re-enqueuing action, such as the verify loop of `S.core.actions.attempt`, therefore keeps its module busy and cancellable until it finishes.

### Modal-aware execution

Each action is gated by a host-modal check before it fires (`60_queue.js:visibleDialogs()`). If any element matching `S.kernel.HOST_DIALOG_SELECTOR` (`div[role="dialog"]`) is visible on the page when the queue tries to run the next entry, the entry is **deferred** (not dropped) — the queue re-polls every `QUEUE_MODAL_RECHECK_MS` (2 s) and resumes the moment the user closes their window. This prevents Steward from yanking a window the user just opened.

A deferral writes a few `queue` lines and nothing per 2 s poll: `deferring <depth> action(s): dialog visible: <list>` on the first poll (L1a), `still deferring ...` at most once per `LOG_REPEAT_MS` (L1b), a one-time WARN at `QUEUE_MODAL_STALE_MS` (L1c), and `resumed after <s> s` (L1d), `deferral ended after <s> s: queue empty` (L1e) or `reset while deferring ...` (L1f) when it ends. The full text is in [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md#kernel-health-lines).

#### A dialog the user cannot see

A steward modal survives a script reload, and a wedged stage can leave one shown behind the game, so only a client restart clears it. The guard does not expire on its own, because a false resume would close a window the user is editing. Instead, after `QUEUE_MODAL_STALE_MS` (10 min) it warns once and the native-menu status shows `queue held <m> min`.

## Module busy contract

**A module is "busy" while it has any pending or in-flight queue work. The scheduler does not call `plan()` on a busy module.**

This means each `plan()` call is *transactional*: the module declares its intent for the current cycle, and that intent is allowed to complete before the module is asked again. Concretely:

- A module's `plan()` enqueues N actions tagged with its id.
- The scheduler skips that module on subsequent ticks until `queue.depthByModule(id) === 0` AND the action that's currently in-flight is not from that module.
- When the queue drains (or `cancelByModule(id)` is called), the module becomes available again. Next tick or wake, `isReady` is re-checked, then `plan()` runs.

Why this matters:

- **Modal pause + busy contract**: user opens a window → drainage pauses → module stays busy → no new `plan()` calls accumulate on top of the pending work. Queue size is bounded by the module's *per-cycle* count.
- **Long-running operations** (an adventure, a production order placed): not represented in the queue once the *kick-off action* fires. The module's own `isReady` returns false while the operation is in flight (e.g. checking `aSession.adventure.name` in autoTSO terms). The busy contract handles the queue side; module logic handles the game-state side.
- **Cancellation is clean**: `queue.cancelByModule(id)` empties the module's pending entries → busy=false → next tick, `isReady` decides whether to start fresh.

Implementation:

```js
// 60_queue.js
S.kernel.queue.isModuleBusy(id);    // pending OR in-flight
S.kernel.queue.depthByModule(id);   // pending count only
S.kernel.queue.runningModule();     // moduleId of currently-executing action, or null

// 50_scheduler.js walkTier
if (S.kernel.queue.isModuleBusy(mod.id)) continue;
```

This contract supersedes any "auto-cancel-before-plan" idea — the same outcome is achieved more cleanly by simply not calling `plan()` until the previous cycle is done.

## Module wake

A module that knows its next step is due before the next tick can ask for one extra `plan()`:

```js
Steward.kernel.scheduler.wake(id, delayMs);   // true when a new wake was armed
```

- **Floor.** The delay is raised to `TIMEOUTS.WAKE_MIN_MS` (250 ms).
- **One per module, earliest due time wins.** A later wake while one is pending returns `false`; a sooner one replaces it.
- **Busy modules wait.** A wake on a busy module neither reads the game nor calls `isReady` or `plan()`. It re-checks after `TIMEOUTS.WAKE_BUSY_RECHECK_MS` (500 ms).
- **No effect on the others.** A wake touches no tier cursor, no `tickCount` and no tick timer, so the other modules keep their turns.
- **Not persistent.** `scheduler.stop()` clears pending wakes. Kernel Pause and script reload both reach it, so no wake survives them.
- **Chains end by themselves.** A wake whose module reports `isReady` false stops there; the next tick restarts it. A `plan()` may call `wake` again to continue a chain.
- **Unknown module or stopped scheduler:** `wake` returns `false` and arms nothing. Throws are swallowed as in a tick.

## Starvation, fairness, and back-pressure

- **Starvation:** prevented by the per-tier round-robin cursor. A misbehaving `Normal` module enqueueing 50 actions per tick still does not starve other `Normal` modules — they get first-look on the next tick.
- **Tier inversion:** a `Critical` module always runs before any `Normal` module in the same tick. There is no preemption within a tick (cooperative model).
- **Back-pressure:** if the queue is non-empty when a tick fires, draining continues; new `plan` calls just append. There is no enforced ceiling on queue depth in v0.1 — modules are expected to gate themselves with `isReady`.

## Tick interval

```js
Steward.kernel.settings.read('scheduler').tickInterval     // default: 10000 (ms)
```

The Settings screen edits it in seconds, with a 10 s minimum. The new value applies at the next tick.

Faster ticks mean tighter responsiveness at the cost of more game-API churn. 10 seconds matches autoTSO's `aQueue.interval` and is a known-safe default.

## Example: a Normal-tier module

```js
(function (S) {
    var state = { cooldownUntil: 0 };

    S.kernel.register({
        id:       'example',
        priority: S.Priority.Normal,
        isReady:  function (ctx) {
            return S.core.zone.isHome() && ctx.now > state.cooldownUntil;
        },
        plan:     function (ctx) {
            var ready = S.core.buildings.list({ type: S.Building.FlyingHouse });
            for (var i = 0; i < ready.length; i++) {
                S.kernel.queue.add('collect', [S.core.buildings.grid(ready[i])]);
            }
            state.cooldownUntil = ctx.now + 30000;
        }
    });
})(Steward);
```

## What this replaces

autoTSO's `aQueue` + ad-hoc `aSession.isOn.*` flags. Reference: `autoTSO/user_auto.js:585`.
